You are NOT allowed to share, show, discuss, or send this tutorial to the manufacturer. I spent more than two months fixing this printer and I would like to have my reader to respect my work by not sharing it to the public. If you would like to support my work, tell me manufacturer to contact me and buy my work instead. I pre-ordered this machine on May 2017 and the machine was shipped to me on June 2017. The machine had missing parts and did not perform as expected. I had to spend a few weeks to reprogram, recalibrate, and rebuild the entire machine. I was very treated meanly by the manufacturer. I am a 22 years old college kid when this tutorial is written at October 2017. I warned one of the \"Engineer\" that this item is a fire hazard due to the fact that all the wiring that they are using are under rated. The \"Engineer\" refused to listen me and claimed that there is nothing wrong with the device. Since this machine did not work as expected and I was treated super badly, I opened a chargeback and successfully got my money back from American Express. The day when this tutorial is written and prepared on October, it has been surpassed the 90 days turnaround time that allow the merchant to revert the chargeback. I still have not hear back from AliExpress or the manufacturer. In this tutorial, I will share a list of modifications including software, hardware, and wiring that I have done to make my machine up and running. I will try to explain everything as detail as possible. If you think something that I have done is wrong or you may want to contribute to this tutorial, please contact me. If you would like to know my background and experiences, please refer to my cv. Clearly, I am not an English major, you will find a lot of typo and grammar mistakes in this tutorial.

The first step is to rebuild the entire machine. Since I pre-ordered this machine on May 2017, my machine came with fanless design. They claimed that this printer is able to print ABS. So I went for a spin and printed something in ABS. As expected, it will not print ABS. Take a note that the wiring that they have done in this fanless design. They are using an under rated wiring connector. According to specification, 40W of power are going through the hotend at peak. This means that the connector will eventually melt under a constant load. At the same time, I found out that the hex screw that feed the filament is loose. I was unable to feed in filament after a few loading and unloading the filament. I contacted the manufacturer on mid June 2017 and requested them to send me E3D V6 clone hotend as I found out that the fanless design is basically trash. They were good enough to send me a E36 V6 clone. However, it took them more than two weeks to mail me that. I was super furious as what they did not do what they promised. When I received the package, everything come in pieces. I was expecting a E3D V6 hotend with all parts assembled. Well, this is how it looks when the hotend is removed. I started tearing down this machine and have more understanding with this machine. I realized that the Z-min wire (wire in red) caused a lot of inconsistency when I auto level my printer. Then, I found out that the tape that holds the extruder and the wire in red is a conductive tape. The tape allow current flow between the hot end and heated bed then they are touched, causing them to have a closed circuit. I started to do a few experiment with my multimeter to see which part of the hotend is a conductor. I found out that they best way of putting the wire on the hot end is actually solder it directly on brass/copper screw (the place where the arrow is connected to). After it is completed, I started to remove as little things as possible and assemble the three fans that they gave me. While taking off everything, I started to remove the wire tape to see what is the best way to connect all the wires. Then, I found out that they did not seal the tape correctly. This is not the only problem, the wire that they use is under rated too. Also, I would recommend everyone to use the wire that come with E3D V6 and connect them directly to the microcontroller. The wire that come with E3D V6 is heat resistance and is built based on the specification. I realized that it is a price of crap since it vibrates a lot due to the fan is running at high speed. The noise made my ears very uncomfortable. Do remember to tighten the thermostat and hotend. The hotend that they sent me with thermostat were not complete. I had to tighten everything. This is a fire hazed if you did not perform this step! Here is another view of the assembled hot end, the three fan design. I started to find an alternative of a hotend cooling fan. I printed this fan to do some experiment. The design is not perfect for my use, but it was a good start. I started to see a better print and it put a smile on my face. This is how my printer looked like at that point. Then, I printed another fan design for another experiment. I printed a calibration cube and found out that the result was not as good as expected. I started to find more fan design that I can use. Since I am not familiar with CAD, I was unable to design my own part. I printed this design and after doing some Googling about the dimensions of my E3D V6 clone, it should work. You may wonder where did I get the second fan. The answer is from the PCB controller board. I later purchased a higher performance fan for the hotend and put back the fan to the original spot. This is the final result of my hotend cooling fan and printing fan solution. Here is a picture of my printer working in action. You can also view the complete timelapse of this print on Youtube. Here is a picture of everything I removed from the machine. One day in August 2017, I started to print ABS with my heated bed set to 100 degree Celcius. At the middle of the print, I smelled something that was burning. I immediately turned off my printer and started to wonder where did the smell came from. I remembered that the only thing that I did not remove while rebuilding my printer was the heated bed. I removed the heated bed and realized that the wiring that goes to the heated bed were melted. I removed the Kaplon tape and you can see that the (under rated) heat tube were burnt. Thank goodness that I did not leave my printer running overnight. If not, my house will be burnt down. I removed the wires and replaced it with 14 AWG wire. I pealed off the two end of the heating element under plastic so that I can solder it directly to the two ends. After the work is done, I put the Kaplon tape back to where it was. I also added high temperature resistance wire tape under the heated bed where the connectors sits on. Do make sure that your soldering is well done. If not, solder will melt under high temperature moved away from the connectors. It is another source of fire hazerd! A list of things to fix: Replace the fanless design with E3D V6. Tighten the hex screw at the extruder that feed filament. Solder the hot end wire to the screw. Tighten the hotend screw and thermostat in hotend. Replace the hotend cooling fan. Replace and solder the heated bed wires to the end of heating elements. "}}

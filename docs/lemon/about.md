# About The Author and Tutorial

This tutorial is written by __Melvin Ch'ng__ and available to all end user at no cost. You are NOT allowed to share, show, discuss, or send this tutorial to the manufacturer. I spent more than two months fixing this printer and I would like to have my reader to respect my work by not sharing it to the public. If you would like to support my work, tell me manufacturer to contact me and buy my work instead. 

I pre-ordered this machine on May 2017 and the machine was shipped to me on June 2017. The machine had missing parts and did not perform as expected. I had to spend a few weeks to reprogram, recalibrate, and rebuild the entire machine. I was very treated meanly by the manufacturer. I am a 22 years old college kid when this tutorial is written at October 2017. I warned one of the "Engineer" that this item is a fire hazard due to the fact that all the wiring that they are using are under rated. The "Engineer" refused to listen me and claimed that there is nothing wrong with the device.

Since this machine did not work as expected and I was treated super badly, I opened a chargeback and successfully got my money back from American Express. The day when this tutorial is written and prepared on October, it has been surpassed the 90 days turnaround time that allow the merchant to revert the chargeback. I still have not hear back from AliExpress or the manufacturer.

In this tutorial, I will share a list of modifications including software, hardware, and wiring that I have done to make my machine up and running. I will try to explain everything as detail as possible. If you think something that I have done is wrong or you may want to contribute to this tutorial, please contact me.

# About Setup Guide

This tutorial is written by __Melvin Ch'ng__ and available to everyone at no cost. You may not reproduce this material without seeking the permission of the author. This is a tutorial that I prepare during my free time. Due to the frequent changes made by the author, the author decided to disable the download feature. 

I do not work for Netgear. I was invited by Netgear to test the Netgear Orbi mesh network kit (RBK53, 1 router with 2 satellites kit) 9 months before they launched it. I was one of the alpha/beta testers in the United States. After the beta test was completed, I moved this kit from USA to Malaysia on January 2017. I am so surprised that many people are unable to get the router to work correctly today (as of July 2017). I, as an Engineering Student, decided to write this guide to help out people that think it is impossible to get it to work with Streamyx or UniFi.

Thank you Simon for providing the part of the screenshots while working with me to get his Orbi to work with his UniFi network. If you have any question, please contact me via e-mail.

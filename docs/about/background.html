<p>I was born and raised in Penang, Malaysia at 1995 - a country that no one knows until recently (if you read the news). The description that I use to describe where Malaysia is when I am telling my friends is: it is a country in under Thailand, on top of Singapore, next to Indonesia, or in Asia.</p>
<p>Then, the next thing people usually ask is which state are you in. Depending on the person, I can tell the story differently. If the person knows about tech, I will simply say I am from &quot;Silicon Valley of The East&quot; and the conversation goes on... If the person loves food, I will simply begin with it&apos;s in &quot;Asia&apos;s Top 10 Greatest Street Food Cities&quot; (If you want to read more about the awards that our city received: <a href="http://penangfoodie.com/penang-is-the-greatest-city-ever/" target="_blank">here</a>)... Well, if the person still does not know anything, I will just pull up my phone and show where I am from on Google Map.</p>

<p>I grew up in a small family. I have a elder brother, 5 years older, that no one really knows. People always think that I am the only child. When I was young, I was taken care by my parents and my brother was taken care by my grandparents. This scenario is very common in my hometown until today, especially if you have both parents that work to support the family. </p>
<p>I hang around at my parents&apos; business most of the time since I was taken care by my parents. They own a car accessories workshop and has been operating for about 30 years now. My dad is the handyman in the house. I inherited his genetics. He love to build, create, and explore. He does everything that you can think of: aquarium from scratch (yes, from glasses), wiring (from low to high voltage and current), and the list goes on. Today, I still enjoy watching him to make stuff. The most impressive thing is he is a dropout high school student, or he just completed his primary school. He knows how to read A-Z, but not when the characters are combined. He does not know how to operate a computer, but he was able to build so many stuff by himself at that time without proper referencing (AKA Google-ing). Aren&apos;t you think what he did at that time impressive? My mom completed her high school and earned an accounting certificate. She helps my dad managing the business. She always bring me to banks and government offices since I was young. This allows me to get familiarize the process, which the skill is extremely useful to have when I grew up.</p>
<p>I was sent to a local pre-school at the age of 5? nearby my house. I don&apos;t remember much of what we are doing when I as at pre-school. 7 years old is the age where parents send their kids to primary school. I was send to a small primary (~300 people for 6 grades total) school nearby my house. There is 6 grades in our primary school system. In primary school, we started learning Chinese (my first language), Malay, and English. Actually, picking up 3 languages at a time when you were young is not that hard. Being sent to a small school was not a bad idea. Since the school was small (40-50 people a grade), you get to know everyone in the class and able to interact with teachers. There was 4 exams a year and the exit exam was at 6th grade. That exit exam I graduated from primary school when I was 12. I wasn&apos;t the smartest kid nor the dumbest kids in the school. Even though I graduated for more than 10 years, I still return to school regularly to spend my morning or afternoon with the teachers that taught me when I was young.</p>
<p>Our high school begin from 7th grade. This time, I was sent to a huge school near our house. There is around 700 people in one grade and 45 student in a class. It was considered huge as there are many school with lower number of students. Since the class was huge, there were not there much interaction between students and teachers. Teachers don&apos;t get to know you that well personally. Again, I wasn&apos;t the smartest kid nor the dumbest kid when I was in high school. We started taking Biology, Chemistry, and Physics classes in grade 9-12. I found out that I did not like to Biology at all since it was all about memorization. Anything that are related to memorization, I will simply ignore it and did badly in class. Luckily, my parents were all fine from that. They asked me to not to worry as long as I can pass my high school exit exam and earned a certificate. I contributed to a few of the school publication when I was there for 5 years. Being in charged of school magazines and school bulletin, I learnt quite a few of the publishing work. I graduated on December 2016 (that is how the school system works here).</p>
<p>I actually have no clue what most of my friends are doing now. I was not close with my classmates in both primary and high school. But, there are a few close friends that in touch with me regularly. Thank you :)</p>

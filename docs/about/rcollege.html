<h2 id="relationship"><a name="relationship" class="plugin-anchor" href="#relationship"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Relationship?</h2>
<p>It was impossible to not to get interested into girls when you were in college. You probably expect me to go through at least a relationship when I was in college, but I am here to disappoint you. I had not gone into any relationship over the years in college. However, I was interested in two different girls at the different period over the four years period. Both of them were still single and had not gone into any relationship as of March 2018 (when this was written) since I met them. Both of them are in college of Engineering, but different major. I believed there was only two or three people that knew about the first girl but I did not mentioned the second one to anyone until the last few days before I left. However, those people that knew about it did not know about them.</p>
<p>I did not plan to have a relationship during college. The main reason for not having one was I did not really need to bother about my the other half when I made any decision. Most of my friends were in relationship always need to worry about their partners when they decide on something: eat with her, make food for him, hangout with him, not allowed to go, etc. I found out that this was very annoying especially when you were super busy and still need to take care for additional stuff. Also, relationship may be emotional, but that depends on your partner. As an International Student in the US, if you were in a relationship, you had to think what to do with your partner after you graduated too.</p>
<p>Well, you can always debate that guys should always take their girlfriend as the top priority. What if you had a inconsiderate girlfriend that always need your attention 24/7? I am not saying that I will not pay attention to them. Instead, attention should be given appropriately. These are just my opinion and you may disagree.</p>
<p><strong>The First Girl</strong></p>
<p>I met the first girl that I liked, but she was not told, in one of the Introduction of Engineering classes. We had a few classes together. She is those kind of person that will only come to you when she need help or want you to hangout with her. I was treated pretty badly in terms of friends too. I was pretty much ignored by her all the time. She spends a lot and she is the kind of girl that guys considered as &quot;high maintenance&quot;. I did not want to give too much clue who this person is as it is not worth mentioning at all. </p>
<p><strong>The Second Girl</strong></p>
<p>I met the second girl I like through a friend. I was invited by my friend to line up for free yoghurt during the free yoghurt day. We chatted a bit while waiting in line for almost two hours. We had a great talk and kept in touch. She is a kind of person that appreciates things and really determined when she comes to problem solving. She will not ask for help unless she really need to.</p>
<p>I texted her ~48 hours before I left the US and told her that I like her and wondering if we can meet up for the one last time for an official good bye since we did not had an official goodbye on the last time we met. She replied my messaged and agreed to meet me up. We met up and had a chat like how it used to be. I had fun chatting and grabbing selfie with her. She said I she felt flattered as I was the first person that said I like her. She wanted to keep it low, so please do not ask around :)</p>

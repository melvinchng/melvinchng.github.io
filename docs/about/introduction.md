# Introduction

The purpose of this autobiography is to document my life, my journey, and my decision. This is a complete autobiography of my life until this point - moving back to my hometown: Penang, Malaysia (as of February 2018). You are here to get to know more about me. But I have written a lot more than you have expected. If you are expecting a short version of the story or for the impatient, I can describe it in a few sentences below:

"I was born and raised in Penang, Malaysia. I went to elementary school and high school (we do not have middle school) in my hometown. I came to United States for my college degree. I moved back to Malaysia after I graduated."

I bet you are not here for just a few sentences above. Continue reading to find more about me! I would recommend you to read my autobiography from the first to the last pages instead of jumping straight to the topic that you would like to know. There will not be duplicates but the related topic will have link to the in depth section if available. Over the time, there will be update and changes to my autobiography.

I tried to design this to be as user friendly as possible with my previous experience writing [Ruby on Rails tutorial](http://melvinchng.github.io/rails). There are reasons why certain things are done in the ways that you see. I apologize in advance if you dislike it. 

Want to know even more about me after reading these or have questions while reading, feel free to contact me at [you.email.melvin@gmail.com](mailto:you.email.melvin@gmail.com). I also created a [Google Docs](https://goo.gl/yEq3S1) for people who would like me to write about something, but want to keep themselves anonymous.

P.S. I am not an English major.

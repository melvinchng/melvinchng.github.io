<p>I met many people during the four years period. It was usually within the group in the field of what I studied and expend it outwards. There are good and bad. Here is a list of people I met:</p>
<p><strong>The Goods</strong></p>
<p>People that who...</p>
<ul>
<li>always offer help when you begin to struggle on certain topic</li>
<li>always catch up with you no matter how busy they are</li>
<li>share their experience with you to make sure you will gain something from it</li>
<li>give or lend you something ASAP that you need</li>
<li>never leave you behind :)</li>
<li>help out whatever you need</li>
<li>always remind you to do something</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bads</strong></p>
<p>People that who ...</p>
<ul>
<li>does not get stuff done and you have to keep on reminding him</li>
<li>always late all the time, even if the meeting is at 12pm, you have to give a call and wake the person up</li>
<li>party all night and unable to wake up as promised to get stuff done</li>
<li>always spend money on party but refused to pitch in to his on group project</li>
<li>never read or respond the text messages and pretend nothing is going on so do not need to get the stuff done</li>
<li>has two faces; treat opposite sex with extremely good attitude</li>
<li>always collaborate on their schedule</li>
<li>only talk to you to get your help but long gone after you give out the things</li>
<li>always spend their time on party and say they do not have time</li>
<li>only show up to the conversation if it is related to the homework topic in the group chat, but not others</li>
<li>always say they are poor but able to afford expensive stuff all the time</li>
<li>try to show off (negative attitude)</li>
<li>does not have knowledge but refuse to listen</li>
<li>refused to collaborate with other people in terms of schedule/time</li>
<li>always says want to hangout, but never have time</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be more in the list. But there is a general list of people I can see by joining them. I won&apos;t say the bads are always the bad as they might not be the best person for school, but may be good for other things. Sometimes, the bads will always be the bads when everyone start to talk about it.</p>

<p>I told my friends that I planned to document my college life. For those who I talked to before I started, they asked me to include them in it. Here you go! But for those who did not know about it, here is the surprise! People below may fall into the bads list mentioned above too! There is no order how it is mentioned. If are the mentioned below and dislike it, contact me and I will take it down :) Also, if you are not in the list below, it was either I planned to find a better picture with you from my phone, I completely forgot, or we do not have a picture together at all. :(</p>

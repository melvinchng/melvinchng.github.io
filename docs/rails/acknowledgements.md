This is not an ordinary coding tutorial that explains in depth in theory. This is a tutorial that shows you examples and step by step process of design, integrate, and test a feature. I am unable to guarantee that my attempt is the most efficient nor all the information in this tutorial is correct. However, I will try my best to keep the the information as accurate as possible. A secondary source such as documentation is required to understand the concept behind. 

Most of the tutorial was written and tested on a Windows 8.1 machine running Ruby 2.2.3 and Rails 5.0 while some of the tutorial was written on Ruby 2.4.1 and Rails 5.1. The code entered into the terminal window may vary based on the operating system and your system configurations. If you followed my Ruby on Rails Windows, Ubuntu Linux, or MacOS installation guide in this tutorial, you should be able to run run the commands in this tutorial without any issue.

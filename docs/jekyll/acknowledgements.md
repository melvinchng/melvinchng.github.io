This is not an ordinary coding tutorial that explains in depth in theory. This is a tutorial that allow people with minimal to zero experience that would like to learn more about coding and web development. I am unable to guarantee that my attempt is the most efficient nor all the information in this tutorial is correct. However, I will try my best to keep the the information as accurate as possible. 

Most of the tutorial was written and tested on a Windows 8.1 machine running on Ruby 2.2.3, Ruby 2.4.1 and Ruby 2.5.1. The code entered into the terminal window may vary based on the operating system and your system configurations. If you followed my Ruby installation guide on Windows, Ubuntu Linux, or MacOS installation guide in this tutorial, you should be able to run run the commands in this tutorial without any issue.
